# Throwaway GitHub Repository

This is a place where I am leanring about working with GitHub repositories

A markup file (.md) is a text file that uses Markup syntax to produce a document that others can read online when they check out your repository.

I hope to learn the following
	
	- How to make a repository
	- How to publish a repository using GitHub Desktop
	- How to make commits to a repository
	
Let's give it a go :) Also, try out [introduction to GitHub] (https://github.github.io/on-demand) to learn more.
